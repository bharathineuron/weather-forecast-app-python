# weather_forecast_app_python

This is an application that gives the probabilities of all the possibilities for the given input data. The values are calculated based on Bayes's theorem. Prior probabilities are calculated based on the data which is already present.

## 📚 Approach
1. Calculate the prior probabilities using the dataset
2. Apply bayes's theorem on prior probabilities and the given information
3. Calculate the posterior probabilities.
